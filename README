Introduction
------------

This project is simply my configuration for wmii.

The project consists of wmiirc_local, the editing of the wmii config, and a
bunch of scripts. The scripts in many cases are quickly thrown together and
aren't a paragon of software development, so take what they do with a grain of
salt.

The biggest problem I had with getting started with wmii was the lack of good
documentation and examples. Hopefully by making this available, it'll be a
little easier for others to get started with wmii.


Status
------

Given that wmii appears to have been abandoned/discontinued/what-have-you, I'm
switching window managers. Meaning that I won't be updating this anymore.

For those that are curious, I'm moving to xmonad (for the moment.)


Requirements
------------

wmii > 3.9.2
    This is what I used, but I expect that more recent version will work for
    the most part.
python 3.x
    Most/all of the python scripts are unlikely to use anything that can't be
    found in 2.x, so it should be easy enough to translate to 2.x
bash
    For the shell scripts. Could likely be easily translated to other shells.


Installation
------------

Simply untar/clone the project to ~/.wmii or ~/.wmii-<version>, whichever is
more appropriate for the version of wmii you're going to be using. I have mine
in ~/.wmii.
